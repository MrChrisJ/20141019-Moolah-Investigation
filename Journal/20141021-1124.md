This is my first Journal entry for this project. This is to confirm that I am taking the role of the investigator and I am timestamping the evidence in real time with the datestamps as follows:  

yyyymmdd-hhmm-Initials  

My intention is to record the evidence as objectively as possible also with mirror links for redundancy. This stage of the investigation I will call *Discovery* and is an object account of the evidence as the investigator finds it periodically committed to the Git Repo and the Git Commit entered in to the Bitcoin Blockchcain as proof of the Discoveryâ€™s narrative.  

That is not the final proof on the truth condition of any allegations which must take place at a later stage but simply proof of the discovery of evidence as the investigator finds it. As more people take part in this process independently of each other the more sure we can be of the truth condition of the evidence when it is finally brought together and consolidated in a Git Merge.  

I am signing this message with my PGP key to lock in the state of this message, I have included the Merkle Root to prove that the creation of this media took place no time prior to the block generation. I do this before I start composing the message.
