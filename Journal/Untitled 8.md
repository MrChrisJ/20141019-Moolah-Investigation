I have had  breakthrough with my project. With Moolah I have been contacted by employees who have direct links with Ryan Kennedy who are giving me very helpful information. 

I also have had lots of thoughts come to me about a global justice system as I have been carrying out the investigation. Including the use of Evidence preparation and encryption, sending the evidence bundle to the respondent encrypted with their PGP key. Then releasing an symmetrically encrypted bundle to BitTorrent for the public to download with a very long password. The respondent is encouraged to reply in a manner that is timely to the needs of the alleged victims. The slower the respondent takes the more incentive there is to release a part of the key of the bundle that is in the public domain. As the key gets easier to hack it provides an incentive for individuals to take matters in to their own hands and either crack the bundle or repeat the work.  

This should place enough pressure on the respondent to reply by adding evidence to the bundle themselves to either: 

1. provide evidence pointing towards their innocence 
2. provide evidence pointing towards their guilt/confession ( less likely)
3. continue to hide    

The more they run away as the evidence mounts in the public bundle the more care the public are incentivised to provide. The case could rise in the hierarchy of attention particularly as more victims emerge over space and time in different communities. If there is any agreement between these communities on what action to take against the alleged perpetrator they can collaborate by comparing evidence using this system for verifiability. 

Over time and as the alleged perpetrator commits more crime across space and time in different communities the evidence against them will mount and will make their activities more costly and it should also create more pressure on them to respond.  

You are looking for a way of managing the release of secret information with accountability and responsibility at the heart. With clear binary decision trees that are very easy for anyone to understand wherever they are from in the world.  

It is my view that we don’t want violent or reckless vigilantes going off and taking the law in to their own hands out of sheer anger as this investigation is finding evidence of. On the other hand we don’t want to give the frauds so much freedom that they are fly away from their crimes and carry on creating more victims in the future.  

During this stage of the investigation I was contacted by former employees at Moolah. I have decided to redact the core content for now using my PGP Key as described in the last journal entry. However this time I have chosen to make the PGP Signature of the redacted file open as I don’t see a strong reason why to keep it encrypted. See [**20141023-1248-CE**](https://github.com/MrChrisJ/20141019-Moolah-Investigation/tree/master/Evidence_Bundle/20141022-1248-CE) for relevant file.  

I am keeping back some evidence from the bundle for now as I am very busy and lots of thoughts keep coming in to my mind and I don’t want to make things too public too quickly but just to give an insight on where I am at the moment I am thinking about collaborative timelines of evidence or competing *narratives* that are able to emerge from the *bundle*. A good tool for this could be [Timeline.JS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) also on [Github](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS).  

I made some other comments over here earlier today on Reddit.

I don't see how you came to this at all, if you trace the coins from the original 3,700 wallet it's very easy to track the coins mostly to the following addresses :
STARTING POINT - https://blockchain.info/address/17ztgkcaZbs4VFrAswMQGvnNDEtn47rsmu?offset=0&filter=0 TRANSACTIONS OVER 100btc LEAD TO THE FOLLOWING ADDRESSES
https://blockchain.info/address/1CUTRqE8Vx8FMEnnsLX6icMmcbi2dTTcpZ 100 btchttps://blockchain.info/address/1LiMat4jwybUUMAMJiGLYcpmdRNniuNiAu 502 btchttps://blockchain.info/address/12UabjvBo7w6ccSSnGb85iCJdkK4drZGBd 352 btchttps://blockchain.info/address/1FfdHMLkGjkXEeQiXcYuznfpnqobjyYEMd 450 btchttps://blockchain.info/address/14i2f49DwDB4CtTDUmvA56D1tRCVB6fU1i 365 btchttps://blockchain.info/address/1ASAvSPCbZd3apQJD2yZpu1o9Uap8pSmQH 124 btchttps://blockchain.info/address/17YMsasWwEuSrBN5SFpK5CLrgE7VWeKmc7 346 btchttps://blockchain.info/address/13LSfRwk9RbYWb9C1TwD1FHZ2FjsntnVDL 227 btc - unconfirmed trans right now!!https://blockchain.info/address/1Gbm8jQTmnWVtFDPAQyYgAGTLujdcDpEJy 180 btchttps://blockchain.info/address/12K5utGf6i6nbiKT7nZGWhTjwA8bxWVPqp 747 btc

Hey this is helpful. But at the moment these are just random numbers. We need to consolidate them with other data points.
To start you can look when each address had its first transaction and plot that on a timeline.  

Now let's say we have a witness statement from staff member saying he was given instructions to send funds to address:https://blockchain.info/address/1NjBaY8fKg85TfCvP1AoQGUSXjifD5Nw2G  

We put the witness statement on the timeline and we plot it against the first known transaction coming in.  

Then as you go through the other addresses note of addresses like this one which comprise as part of multiple outputs:https://blockchain.info/address/1GVNvnEedkfmDNSAndgBHxiH5Xb5ny9t6P  
 There aren't many wallets that let you do this, so it was either done directly in the exchange software or it was done in Bitcoin QT or some other advanced wallet.
Pay attention to the time of day and cross check it with any tweets from @Moolah_io. Try to log everything in UTC time for synchronisation with other investigators.
Once you have excluded the change addresses and you have a good idea of a narrowed down list (your one is pretty good as it is) go to: https://www.google.co.uk/alerts  

Put the suspect Bitcoin addresses in to daily Google Alerts so that when any blog posts up the address you are notified. Also maybe put up an [ANN] thread on Bitcoin talk and tweet about it.  

Get interviews with the staff and ask them what they know. Record everything. Record the time and date and the people present. Store it safely. Then keep following the leads.  

I will keep working on this but good job, your post was really useful, thanks.

## Improving the Blockchain Clock

The other thing that has been tormenting my mind is the idea of a different kind of timestamping using the blockchain that doesn’t involve such a long winded quote of the Block number and the full merkle root.  

What if we just create a new kind of clock using blockchain data and Modular arithmetic to create a new kind of clock face. I have said before that one of the problems with clocks is that while we know there will be a 3pm every single day we don’t know what will happen at 3pm. And it is a feature of the blockchain to have a unique hash and merkle root with the introduction of every new block. Therefore we can take this is proof of knowledge that is synchronised with a point on the clock face that nobody in the world can deny provided minimal understanding of this technology. This further proves that the event could not take place anytime sooner.  

It strikes me that we could incorporate this in to the PGP Signing scheme. Instead of using the system clock to salt the message we could instead do a call to the blockchain and get a short message thus:  

**326627-97d9fc9**  

We have the block height to the left of the hyphen and we have the beginning of the merkle root to the right. This should be enough information to prove the time as the chances of matching the right merkle root to the block height I imagine is extremely low. This should reduce data size but if space is not an issue then we could continue as normal and simply use this form of notation as short hand like dd/mm/yy.  

This would improve the PGP Signing scheme a lot as now we have a PGP Signature that more resembles an old analogue signature. Who you are and what you do emerges with the whole world just as it does when you sign your name. Every signature is slightly different and yet uniquely traceable to you. In the past signature authentication required specialists. If the PGP Private Key also required some Biometric as well as frequent revoking and renewal requiring peers to authenticate in an offline environment then I think this could be powerful, especially when brought back again to the public sphere with signatures published in online social networks.  

Thank-you for your time :)
