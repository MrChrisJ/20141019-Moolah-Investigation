This is an experimental investigation technique using the a GitHub repository and and the Bitcoin blockchain to conduct an investigation on [Moolah.io](https://moolah.io/).  

The methods used are still very new but the intention is to create an unbreakable record of witnessed events which are timestamped in to the Bitcoin blockchain and identified using their cryptographic digests in the git repository.  

Nothing contained in this repo should be considered final or proof of guilt of any party whatsoever as this it is too early rely on this technology as legal proofs. However if you would what you see you are encouraged to get involved and put in some pull requests with any information you may have regarding the distrusted crypto currency exchange.  

Please feel free to send in your suggestions or criticisms on the techniques employed.
